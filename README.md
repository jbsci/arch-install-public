# archlinux_install
Public version of my install scripts for setting up an Archlinux System to my usual environment. 

Not fully tested, essentially a pruned version of my private repo with my keys and other personal configs. 

Clone this repo to a fresh Arch install, then in the "installScripts" directory run `./masterInstall.sh`
